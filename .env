# For development purposes, note Next.js supports a .env.local

# The public URL to use for absolute URLs, which are required when
# the Next.js app is run within the Sitecore Experience Editor.
# This should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineApplicationUrl`
# in your Sitecore configuration (see \sitecore\config\JssNextWeb.config).
# Be sure to update these values accordingly as your public endpoint changes.

# To secure the Experience Editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app
# (`/api/editing/render` by default), a secret token is used. This (client-side)
# value must match your server-side value (see \sitecore\config\JssNextWeb.config).
# We recommend an alphanumeric value of at least 16 characters.

# Your Sitecore API key is needed to build the app. Typically, the API key is

# when building locally (if you've never run `jss setup`), or when building in a
# higher environment (since `scjssconfig.json` is ignored from source control).
# In this case, use this environment variable to provide the value at build time.
